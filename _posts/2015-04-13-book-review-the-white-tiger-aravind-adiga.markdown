This is an interesting book.
It presents a different kind of entrepreneurship.
One that requires a person to kill, bribe and lie through their way in the system in order to be successful.
One where people are denied their chance to succeed in the world due to various societal factors.

I like the book because it presents a different take on entrepreneurship and how an unassuming person can slowly be converted to a plotting serial killer.
Beyong that, there's not much to take away from the book. It can get a bit depressing if you're faint-of-heart.

Rating: 3/5
