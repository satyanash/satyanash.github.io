I wanted to record a few thoughts on the rating system that I am using for movies and books.

It is a very simple system with the following scheme:

1. Very Bad
2. Bad
3. Average
4. Good
5. Very Good

It provides enough information to find out in which set a given book or movie is classified.
I refrain from using fractionals as they add unneeded resolution to the system.

A zero rating is not used as that would mean that either the movie or book is not rated or does not exist.

Any book or movie that has a rating of 3 or below is mostly forgettable and is part of the reason why this blog exists.
