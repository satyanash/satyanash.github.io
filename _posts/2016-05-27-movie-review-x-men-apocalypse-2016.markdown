This is probably going to be the last comic book movie I watch without proper pre-evaluation.
There is literally nothing new in the movie.
Bland would be an understatement.

Watching Quicksilver do his thing is literally the only redeeming quality of this movie.
And accounting for the time dilation due to his superhuman speed the actual duration of his work is miniscule.

Not worth the money.

Rating: 2/5 ( Bad)
