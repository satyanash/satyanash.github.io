This movie is a [historically inaccurate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Imitation_Game#Accuracy) account of [Turing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) and how he cracked the Enigma.

The movie revolves too much around the creation than the creator and is a poor rendition of such an excellent personality.

The movie portrays Turing having a weak spot for the machine that he's built and does not want to lose it.
I believe that this is an insult to his memory as for any mathematician a challenge once solved is solved.
The solution is not a prized possession or a gift to be fawned upon.

Turing in his real life moved onto more interesting and better problems instead of crying over a machine.
The movie portrays him as a hopeless dying scientist who mourns the loss of his creation when clearly he was capable of better things.

Effectively the film fails at being a documentary as well as a good memoir of the father of computer science and artificial intelligence.

The [production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Imitation_Game#Production) of the movie clearly indicates that it was simply a mint to the bean counters.
A movie on Alan Turing deserves a lot more love.

Rating: 2/5 ( Bad)
