Essentially a barrage of dirty jokes first from Robert de Niro and then from the rest of the cast.

Once you actually get beyond the jokes, the story is like any other mushy romantic comedy where you should follow your dreams.
The jokes are funny till they aren't.

Effectively an empty movie with a supposedly great cast.

Rating: 1/5 (Very Bad)
