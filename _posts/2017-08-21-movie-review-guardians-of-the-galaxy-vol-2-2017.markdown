Touted as the much awaited sequel to the first volume, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 appears with the same circus pack of alien humanoids and similar galactic scale events of destruction.

A superhero movie that thrives on it's writer's ability to whip out appropriate 80s references on demand.
This coupled with the Awesome 80s Playlist Vol. 2 makes it a nostalgia trip for anyone who's been keeping up with American pop culture for a non trivial amount of time.

A common normie exercise is to list out all the references you could spot and then feel good about yourself.
So let's do that:

* Knight Rider
* Sam and Diane in Cheers
* Mary Poppins
* Pacman game

Maybe even proceed to compile an online list of all such notes.
But wait, people already do that now ( it's called film journalism):

* [All the Retro 80s References in 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'](https://www.inverse.com/article/31228-guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2-80s-easter-eggs-references)
* [15 Easter Eggs You May Have Missed in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2](http://time.com/4761978/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2-easter-eggs/)

So I guess there's not much for me to write about here.
Don't thank me for the links.

Rating: 3/5 (Passable)
