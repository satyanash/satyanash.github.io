This is a tongue-in-cheek story of the concierge and lobby boy of The Grand Budapest Hotel as narrated to an author.

One must strike a careful balance in order to make sure that the humour doesnt overpower the plot or is too invisible to be noticed.
There are a few good jokes but they run out of steam quite quickly.
It fails to be funny as often as needed and may come out as a suspense film with an average plot.

The movie manages to explain all the events that take place without leaving any loopholes.
I guess this is an achievement considering it's comical premise where a lot of things are to be taken lightly.

The narration and artistic style remind me of a TV show called [A Bit of Fry and Laurie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Bit_of_Fry_and_Laurie) but it's quality of humour was far superior( and crazier) than what is seen in this movie.

It was mostly a forgettable experience and not something I'd recommend for a second viewing.

Rating: 3/5 ( Average)
