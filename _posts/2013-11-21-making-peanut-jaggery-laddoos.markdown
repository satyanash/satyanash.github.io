The process is quite easy:

1. Take peanuts, roast ‘em
1. Take jaggery lumps, crush ‘em
1. Blend peanuts and then add the crushed jaggery. Blend again.
1. Stop once you have a nice mixture. If you are hungry skip to step 6.
1. Take lumps of mixture in hands and ball it into a rough sphere or laddoo, you can make them as big or small you want.
1. Eat.
