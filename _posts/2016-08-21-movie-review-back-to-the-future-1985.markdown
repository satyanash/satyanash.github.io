This movie is often listed as one of the best time travel movies.
I'd watched this movie in bits and pieces before but never as a whole.
The movie is as they say, _light_, and can act as a decent introduction to the concept of time travel.

Paced really well, it makes for an entertaining watch without letting inexperienced viewers get lost in figuring out the plot.
Almost everything happens for a reason.
And when it doesn't, it does so without leaving a gaping hole in the plot.
The story is spun in such a way it allows for these surprises to be added without real cost to the plot.

The genius of the plot is the fact that it uses the construct of time travel to bring about an otherwise impossible situation.
The actual events that take place when Marty is in the past are well within the confines of a general romantic-action flick.
However, the stakes are raised by the fact that Marty could entirely disappear if he did not fix is parent's past.

This is an excellent example of an entirely original movie.

Rating: 5/5 (Very Good)
