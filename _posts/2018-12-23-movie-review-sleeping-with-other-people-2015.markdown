This movie has a very Master of None feel to it.
Not much happens other than them trying to figure out what the hell is going on with their and their friends lives.

Then there's this birthday party which is apparently the most publicizied scene from the movie.
The two characters basically attend it in a MDMA induced high and the girl begins dancing in a trance like state, much to the surprise of the kids and parents at the party.
Though since they're all friends, it's okay and nobody complains.
They hang out by the pool and try to understand what went wrong with their lives when compared to the rest of the world.

It talks of sexual dependence and how it can prevent a person from moving ahead from their previous partners and creates a toxic reliance on the other persons reactions.

Rating: 3/5 (Average)
