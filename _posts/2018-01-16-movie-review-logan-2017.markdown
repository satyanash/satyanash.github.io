The much awaited finale to Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, Logan is an A-rated flick with no holds barred cursing, blood and gore.
It feels much closer to Wolverine's essence than any film before it.

The movie works because Wolverine is not the invincible killing machine that he was always portrayed as.
His limp, spectacles and constant heaving make it abundantly clear that he is vulnerable and plain _not_ okay.

Like all previous wolverine movies, this one employs action sequences that are very local to the hero.
This has always been in contrast to the other ensemble movies like The Avengers, X-Men or Fantastic Four where it's always the world that is at stake; complete with gigantic spaceships, aliens swarming some metropolitan city and a huge pillar of light at the center.
This difference is important because it shows how Logan's story is very much a personal journey and doesn't directly affect the world's fate.
And since these stunts sequences are so local to the situation, they become much more relatable and enjoyable for the audience. 
It actually feels like things are at stake instead of it being painfully obvious that some overpowered mortals and underpowered gods will inevitably save the earth.

The initial few action sequences are the most well choreographed.
Every single set piece is used nicely: the scaffolding, the train, the water tower, the fences, the cars.
The huge water tank where Charles is kept is very reminiscent of Cerebro's hollow from where we're so used to seeing the Professor operate.
You know you're in a for a treat.

Charles' seizures that result in the mass disablement of all the people around him is a throwback to Quicksilver's abilities demonstrated in the previous X-Men movies.

After that it goes to shit.
Once the interval is over, some random doctor comes along and proclaims to be behind the mutant extermination.

The moment you see the trio get friendly with a normal family you know that it's not going to end well for them.
And the whole dinner scene and interaction is a way to make you feel close to them.
But I suppose it's important to the movie because they want to show that nobody who is close to Wolverine actually survives.
But most people will have seen the previous movies and would know that it is how it has always been.
And that family also ends up dying very predictably. 

The only real way to make this a challenge for Logan was to create another Wolverine.
That's it. The only way. And since your dear Logan is now old and lame, he stands no chance against this new and strong one.

Originally the movie wants you to think that the metal handed guy is the enemy.
Then he is just an enforcer for the doctor and the real weapon is a Wolverine clone without any emotions.
The metal hand guy seems to just be a spectator providing no advantage whatsoever and is not even scary, just a distraction.

The Admantium bullet makes recurring appearances indicating that it will be used at some point in the movie.
The moment you see the second Wolverine, you know what it's going to be used for.

Over time it should become apparent that the movie is chiefly about two things: Logan being tired of his obscenely long life and wanting to die, but also grudgingly doing that last good deed before achieving goal one.

Beyond that point the movie becomes a predictable charade barely managing to keep up.
The only reclaiming thing about the movie is that everyone dies in the end and there's no post credit scene announcing another godforsaken sequel.

Rating: 3/5 (Average)
