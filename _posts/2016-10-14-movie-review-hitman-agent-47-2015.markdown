The first movie in the Hitman franchise was bad enough to also make it the last.
As a fan of the Hitman series of games, I can say that it did not capture any of the Hitman 'essence' and also failed at being a good action movie.
Naturally, I was quite surprised when they announced another Hitman movie.
I hoped that they would do good on atleast one of the fronts and get things right this time.

Nope.
This movie is worse if not as bad as the last one.

The villian is plain boring and the premise tries to give Agent 47 feelings and other shit that simply shouldn't be there.
If you're doing that, you better have a darn good reason to do it.
I see no point in reusing an existing character if you're going to piss all over it anyway.

I don't see how they managed to convince producers to fund a movie featuring Agent 47.
It's not like the game is a AAA platinum title or something.
In fact, the games belong to a genre which require the player to actually think about how to perform a given mission instead of simply twitching and shooting.
So it's not really a good candidate for a movie script.

Rating: 2/5 (Bad)
