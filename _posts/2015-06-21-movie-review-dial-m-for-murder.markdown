This was my third Hitchcock movie after *Vertigo* and *The Birds*.
Was only able to really follow it till the intermission.
But I think that's mostly because it was 0400 in the morning.
Things got especially confusing when multiple keys to different locks were introduced.
Wouldnt mind seeing the movie again to get a better idea.

Also managed to spot Hithcock's cameo in the reunion photograph on the wall.

Rating: 3/5
