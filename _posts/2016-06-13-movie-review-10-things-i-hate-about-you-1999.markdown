Romantic comedy plots have a tendency to be highly predictable and this one is no exception.
I suppose there's a really fine line between a romantic comedy and a romantic _cringey_.

The introductory scene is a nifty parody of the oft skewed portrayals of american high school dynamics. 
A device that has been overly abused since the time this film was released.

I'd only seen Heath Ledger's performance on the 'The Dark Knight' before, so this younger character offers a nice new perspective.

The story has been adapted from William Shakespeare's 'The Taming of the Shrew'.
I hope the original plot is not as ill-starred as this on-screen rendition.

Rating: 3/5 ( Average)
