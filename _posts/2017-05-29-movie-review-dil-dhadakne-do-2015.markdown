I've been told that Farhan Akhtar has a reputation for making movies about rich people.
This seems to be a continuation of the trend.

![Dil Dhadakne Do (2015)](/img/movie-poster-dil-dhadakne-do-2015.jpg 'Dil Dhadakne Do (2015)')

This movie focuses on a rich family on their boat along with their rich frenemies.
Their rich-ass problems and their hapless attempts to put an end to them with varying results.

It is supposed to be narrated through the eyes of a dog owned by the family.
But not really because he appears like five times throughout the movie.

Pretentious Movie Reviews said it best in their review for _Hum Saath Saath Hain_:

> Hum Saath Saath Hain is a movie about a wealthy family that suffers a mild inconvenience and then it all works out.

This movie is not much different and in the end everything works out complete with a pool party in the ocean.

Rating: 3/5 (Average)
