title: "[Movie Review] The Martian (2015)"
---

The movie makes excessive use of common tropes and dilutes the science.

Sarcasm is overused to the point where it becomes unfunny.

The visuals are great.

You can literally see the points where the movie specifically inserted jokes for the general audience.

This movie could've been a great attempt at explaining planetary science, but is just a oo-aa light sci-fi flick that will soon be forgotten by the audience.

The movie doesn't actually fuck with the science in the books and is true to the rules of space.

The movie does a very good job of portraying how extremely _hard_ space is.
Spaceships take extra-ordinary amounts of time to travel, environments that are so hostile that humans cannot survive without their own machinery, complex calculations that a single person cannot possibly perform are required to perform even the slightest of tasks.

The movie can act as a good reminder to the audience of the important work that scientists across various facilities and countries are doing.

China's intervention in the mission felt a bit forced and the movie could've worked well without it.
