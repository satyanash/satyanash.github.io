Another day, another Hitchcock movie. I intend to slowly wade through all of them.
This one is a suppossed thriller where an American reporter is assigned as the *foreign correspondent* in Europe to cover the events that lead up to a fictional World War II.

People also seem to take Van Meer's apparent death very lighly.
I can't imagine people smiling and making fun of each other when not a few minutes ago your chief guest was assassinated at point blank range.

When ffolliott reveals his knowledge of Fisher's plans, one can't help but wonder why did he not bother to atleast have a look inside the fishy windmill that Huntley spotted. Being a reporter, he should atleast take note of the instinct of his fellow reporter.

The plan that ffolliott and Huntley cook up seems pretty brain dead.
Any plan where you don't want the kidnappee to know they've been kidnapped is bound to fail.

Moreover, the place where Huntley takes Ms. Fisher is quite far away from the city.
He should've had plenty of time to report his blunder to ffolliott before he went in to deal with Mr. Fisher.

The picturization of the plane and it's crashing is pretty well done for a movie from 1940. The old school way of having a dedicated person on board to send and recieve messages for you seems very interesting.

Rating: 3/5
