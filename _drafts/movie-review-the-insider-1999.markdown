title: "[Movie Review] The Insider (1999)"
---

One of the good films I've managed to watch in a while.
All the acting is believable and there are no loose ends anywhere.
The movie is based on real life events involving tobacco whistle-blower Jeffrey Wigand's controversial documentary on CBS' 60 Minutes.

The movie manages to bring forth all your opinions related to law, corporate culture, freedom and whether you really have a choice when handling such things.

The first part of the movie focuses primarily on Jeffrey Wigand's dilemma of whether to expose Big Tobacco or safeguard his family.
While the second part focuses on Lowell Bergman's efforts to get the controversial interview aired against CBS' wishes.

During this he is forced to take a vacation during which he also investigates the [Unabomber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kaczynski) case.
This crosscutting plot adds a bit of noise to the already delicate situation in the movie and seems a bit unnecessary.

Rating: 4/5 ( Good)
