title: "[Book Review] Artemis Fowl: The Last Guardian (2012)"
---


This is the last book in the series of 8 books and Eoin Colder has promised that this is going to conclude the Artemis Fowl saga. The elation I experienced when I first saw that another book in the series was finally published was similar to the one I experienced when I found out that there existed more than one Artemis Fowl books.

The book picks up after the event of The Atlantis Complex and features the return of several characters such as Kelp, Foaly, Mulch, Juliet, Myles and Becket Fowl. Opal Koboi has another sinister plan to take over the world by wiping out the human race altogether.

As promised the book systematically concludes a number of story lines started by previous books while still keeping the reader engaged in the main story line. The story has to introduce a few extra characters such as Caballine - Foaly's wife, Nopal - Opal's clone and Gruff - a troll who is somehow mixed into the story.

In its efforts to wrap up previous books the story adds more lore such as well troll mounted dwarves, spontaneous nuclear fission of time travelling people.

I specifically did not like the ending where Artemis is killed and then his soul re imbibed into one of his clones.
It also does not explain the memory loss that he goes through.

The gruff character seems specifically introduced for Mulchs help and to free him from his LEP hassles.

NÂ°1 has an appropriately minimal role as adding him to the story would have resulted into more work for the author.

Myles is shown to be equally intelligent as Artemis and knows the periodic table by heart. However he still does not know the impracticality of a parrot doing his homework which is just contradictory.

Koboi's younger version is helpfully dealt with early in the book.

Foaly is happily married to Caballine who is an expert in martial arts..
