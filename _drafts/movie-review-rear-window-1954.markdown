title: "[Movie Review] Rear Window (1954)"
---

The movie has a very interesting plot where professional photographer Jeffries is confined to his apartment due to a broken leg and peeps into the lives of his various neighbors through his rear window to pass time.

As he is observing his neighbors he devises a theory where he believes that one of his neighbors Thorwald has murdered his bedridden wife in cold blood.

This theory is then further developed through various incidents that he observes.

Jeff's nurse Stella, his girlfriend Lisa and his private eye friend Doyle all dismiss his theory at first but then slowly get more interested as they go.

The tension is always building up as the movie progresses.
The ending however is very anticlimatic as you expect one of Hitchcock's twists but it never actually happens.
Jeff is right all along and they manage to catch Thorwald red handed.

I found the other neighbors and their stories to be a bit distracting to the main plot.
Lot's of [Checkhov's Guns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chekhov's_Gun) are never fired and leave you wondering why they were actually involved in the plot.
They could've toned them down as the story progressed.

The movie's cinematography is very different from what we're generally used to and some of the ingredients used are very effective.
All of the movie takes place in the courtyard of an apartment complex from Jeff's point of view only.

Rating: 3/5
