title: "[Movie Review] Psycho (1960)"
---

This is supposed to be Hitchcock's most acclaimed movie.
I find it pretty good considering the time it came out in.

Though the first part of the movie focuses on the $40,000 that are stolen while the remaining part is concerned with the mystery at the Bates Motel.

Why did the policeman scene and the car changing scene had to be shown at all, if don't make a difference to the plot at all.
