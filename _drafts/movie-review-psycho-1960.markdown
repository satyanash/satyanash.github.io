title: "[Movie Review] Psycho (1960)"
---


I'd first heard of Psycho when I read that there was a tribute to it in Pulp Fiction.
This is supposed to be Hitchcock's most acclaimed movie.

The story builds up slowly as Marion steals $40,000 from her employer in Phoenix and hurriedly makes way to her boyfriend Sam in Fairville.
En route she encounters her boss, a suspicious policeman and decides to swap her car for another.

She decides to stay over for a night at a Motel run by the Bates mother-son duo.
During her stay, she is murdered by the mother then disposed off by Norman.
Mind you this is 50 minutes into the movie where 

I find it pretty good considering the time it came out in.

Though the first part of the movie focuses on the $40,000 that are stolen while the remaining part is concerned with the mystery at the Bates Motel.

Why did the policeman scene and the car changing scene had to be shown at all, if don't make a difference to the plot at all.
