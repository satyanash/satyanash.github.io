title: "Notes on the Rating System"
---

I wanted to record a few thoughts on the rating system that I am using for movies and books.
It is a very simple one as follows:

1. Very Bad
2. Bad
3. Average
4. Good
5. Very Good

This provides enough information to find out in which part does a given book or movie fit.
I mostly refrain from using fractionals as they unecessarily add unneeded resolution to the system.

A zero ( 0 ) rating is not used as that would mean that either the movie or book is not rated or does not exist altogether.

When evaluating the rating all books/movies begin at 3 and move upward or downwards as they progress.
The final value at the end of the evaluation is what is considered.
