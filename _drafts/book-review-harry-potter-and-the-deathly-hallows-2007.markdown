*Bravo*! That's all I have to say to Rowling. A fitting ending to a fantastic series.
This is one of the few books that has maintained it's quality consistently throughout the series making for a very entertaining read.

I find it fascinating that a person can think of an ending before even starting work on the first book.
But I guess that's a testament to the author's capabilities.
Rowling had already written the [last chapter in 1990](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5119836.stm) and had to perform a dauntingly imaginative task for 17 years!

An interesting pattern I recognized is that the number of pages keeps growing with each book in the series.
This is obviously needed to explain the developments as the story progresses.
The books also seem to grow along with it's audience as clearly, the first book is much lighter as compared to the last one.

At various points during the last three books, you can probably tell that Rowling had to introduce a number of magical *saves* to further the plot.
This can also be thought of as a gradual discovery of the wizardry world from Harry's perspective, but sometimes it just gets too convenient.
Think Hermione's parents, thestrals, silencing charms, twin wands not affecting each other's owners, fiendfyre etc.
I'll still let it pass because all of it is consistent enough to not distract from the story and Rowling has probably spent quite an effort on compacting the already tight plot. 

The [death toll](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_deaths#Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows) is quite hefty: including notable characters like Hedwig, Mad Eye Moody, Dobby, Fred Weasley, Snape, Lupin, Tonks and finally Voldemort.
The deaths and dealing with the loss is a major part of the book.

The author also makes it a point to involve or at least mention all the characters from the previous books: Ginny, Neville, Kreacher, Dobby, Bill, Fleur, Ollivander, Krum, Lavendar, Grawp, Umbridge, Dragons, Ollivander et al.
Not being a potterhead, I had to do a double-take when some of the more obscure names came along: Stan Shunpike, Fenrir Greyback, Colin Creavy, Lavendar Brown.

Important locations like 12 Grimmauld Place, Forbidden Forest, Gringotts, Malfoy Manor, King's Cross, The Burrow, The Room of Requirements, Hogsmeade, Shrieking Shack, Chamber of Secrets and The Ministry of Magic also make a reappearance and are a nice reminder of the depth of the Potter world.
Objects are also important plot points such as Dumbledore's deluminator, Harry's first Golden Snitch, Godric's sword, the sorting hat, Sirius' mirror shard.

Some backstories such as *Tales of Beedle the Bard*, *The Prince's Tale* and the *Bloody Baron's tale* make for a particularly rich reading and offer a peek into the unwritten lore of the Harry Potter universe.

And now I can finally go and be disappointed by the movies.

Rating: 5/5 ( Very Good)
