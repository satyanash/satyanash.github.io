title: "[Book Review] The Fountainhead - Ayn Rand (1943)"
---

It's almost impossible to have not heard exclaimed mentions of *The Fountainhead* before you start it; ergo it's also impossible to not have formed a certain idea of how the book might be.

The book takes it's own sweet time to introduce the characters.
They are developed over incredibly long periods and I guess this development is central to the effect *The Fountainhead* has on the reader.
The rearing nature and slow reveal is what makes the treatment successful.
If one hurries up this process, it tends to look artificial and even contrived at times.

The book comes divided into four parts, which seems like a decent way to partition this review as well.

### Peter Keating

He is good at what he does, but the question he asks himself, whether architecture is the real thing he wants to do.
It's clear that it is not what he really wanted to do and therefore he is fine with whatever crooked business goes along with his profession as it is not his *passion*.

### Ellsworth M. Toohey

Originally I liked this guy a lot, he is still one of the most memorable chatacters in the book.
In the beginning, I assumed that he was a good guy.

I find the Toohey character to be the most interesting in how he can twist and turn humans to do his bidding.
And the fact he apparently wants to use this power of his for the betterment of mankind in general and not for any kind of personal gain.
He is so devoted to this aim that he wont let other people who are more individualistic in nature to come up on their own.
An interesting point I remember him saying was that maybe genius should also be treated as an abnormal growth similar to elephantiasis.

Another point to note was that Toohey was never particularly good at math.

Toohey's monologue to Keating finally reveals his real intentions which we have received so many peeks of till this point.
The monologue also helps to convey and clarify his ideology which was somewhat blurry to me till this point.
The monologue is interesting enough to warrant creation of a small handbook which outlines the idea in a crisper form for easier consumption later on.
Maybe call it something like 'Elseworth Monkton Toohey's Guide to the Ultimate Power'.

### Gail Wynand

The man from Hell's Kitchen.
He is one of the few people who really appreciate Roark and agree with his ideology.

Gail Wynand looks like a pretty straightforward person to me.
And that's what's cool about him.
As he himself mentions, he finds Dominique( god I _love_ that name) to be the cleanest person that he has met ever.
And since she too amuses him so much, he proposes to her.

### Howard Roark

He just loves what he does, and wants to do only that. 
I wish real life were that simple.

He doesnt understand how people can fuck so badly with their professions and still live with it.
He is still practical, and is willing to work just to keep himself alive.

Roark's monologue is very well articulated.
I'm surprised the court let him speak for so long, especially when he begins his case from a seemingly unrelated point.
It also deserves it's own handbook.
Ideally with the ending words of the book printed in bold on the back side of the book.

You may be wondering why I say both deserve recognition?
It's because even though the book champions Roark's MO, while showing how Toohey's way *feels* bad is a very clever way of disguising your point.

----

People change their outlook, become ruthless or mild depending on their surroundings and it is apparent from what I've read till this point.

## Quotes 

The book has some pretty interesting quotes which I have collected as I read through it.
This would probably be a good time to start making a private quote DB.
The number of quotable lines in this book is astonishingly high.
Some interesting quotes from the book:

> Keating: Atleast show some kindness by acknowledging a person by hating him.
> Roark: Who said I was kind.

## Robots

Over time the characters feel almost robotic in nature, and you begin to wonder if these kind of characters are actually possible at all in the real world?

I find the book like a simulation where a few characters with very rigid, almost robotic intentions are dropped into the real world.
Their behaviour is then observed over a period of time and in relation to the field of architecture.

This really makes me wonder if we can predict the behavior of these people through some sort of computer simulation.

This simulation comes up with very interesting results towards the end.
The robots talk of love, and how it is the great exception-making for the person you love.

## In the air

This books is so abstract that it feels like it's the mathematics of the literary world.

This was also a very tiring read in my opinion, I had to go over multiple paragraphs repeatedly just to figure out what was going on in the character's mind.

## Why architecture?

I also find it interesting that Ayn Rand pushes the achievement of man above all else.
Denounces nature and still chose 'architecture' as the preferred medium to explain her philosophy.
When in reality science and technology are the _real_ achievements of man and can be used to bend nature to man's will.
They are the true indicators of Man's greatness over nature.

Maybe she just wasn't a STEM wali.. ;-)
I guess doing that would've risked this book being classified as Science Fiction, which would've driven away quite a bit of people.

## Miss Rand's box of tricks

The author is very adept at using copious amount of words to coat her side and show how Roark is better.
That is also probably why the book is so large.
It is interesting to note that the book never explicitly criticizes Toohey, it recognizes his intelligence and the effectiveness of his methods.
But in the end the book presents a lopsided view of the world.

## Anti Fountainhead

Maybe, there is scope for a book that presents both views so neutrally while still showing how a *Second-Hander* would come out at the top.
It'd have to be in excruciating detail in order to not offend and repel any semi-closed minded people who'd happen to read this anti-fountainhead.

This may also be due to the fact that I am reading the book almost 73 years after it was released.
I may have the advantage of seeing how communism, socialism and democracies have turned out.
I wonder how Miss Rand would've changed her views in respect to this new world.

The book also notes that the drooling monster of collectivism, is something that is never going to die and the world is going to keep needing individualist people who'd bring it on it's tracks.
But on the other hand we also need the collective power to correct the individual fanatics as it is guaranteed that brash incompetent individualists are going to also be a product of the system.
This is a very interesting problem as the same individuals may end up producing the inventions and discoveries that Man is so well known for.
The book itself presents a moral dilemma and even provides a solution, albeit a convenient one.

## Meta Toohey

Then there's also the nagging thought I keep having that is this book popular only because of the real world (anti)Toohey's who decided to push it just because they see how crap it is?
Whatever it may be, the content is interesting enought and provides dollops of food for thought.

## Toohey vs Roark

In the end, sure I _am_ taking the middle road.
I don't agree with Toohey completely, nor do I agree with Roark.
They both represent extremes of a perfect ideology which cannot exist but in a simulation.
As I mentioned before, the characters are almost robotic in nature, which is not how the real world is.

So does this mean that we all are Keatings of this world?
Unsure of what to do next, meeting ends?

Maybe one should do a perusal of history and try to align popular people on either Roark's or Toohey's side.
I have a feeling that Roark's side is going to be rather crowded compared to Toohey's.
People of Toohey's temperament tend to be invisible as they're there only for the power, not the recognition.

## Dealing with people

This book also rings close to my head as I've often heard the phrase: 'The world is full of people, you're going to have to deal with them someday.'
being repeated to me.
I always hated it being that way, but there's not much I can do to change it.
Roark's case seems like a contrived example to put forward a win on the side of individualism.

A better way to validate Miss Rand's ideology is too observe history, conduct empirical experiments and also try to see if you can come up with a Fountainhead-like story for every other profession that every person would like to take up.
In the end, if you cannot sell what you make, you gun die bru.

## literary marvel

I also find it interesting that a person can come up with so much thought for a completely fictitious character.
When you really look at it, there's not much story in the book.
Most of the prose goes into explaining what the characters are feeling and thinking, instead of advancing the storyline.
Actual happenings are trivially *handled* and even glazed over when not absolutely necessary.
I sense that this is going to be the first of many philosophical fiction books that I am going to read.

## Relating to Roark

I personally can relate to Roark much more than anyone else.
I find it hard to decide if this is the book's doing or a result of my own thought process.

## Pity? Are you serious Miss Rand?

You do not agree with Roarks pity on keating
Another interesting point in the story is when a washed up Keating shows Roark his paintings. 
Roark looks at the paintings and tells him that it's too late for him.
The book describes Roark as having felt pity for him ( and that it is the worst feeling in the world).

Now I don't entirely agree with Roark here. There's nothing stopping Keating from doing his own thing.
If history is any indication, age hardly matters when you want to _really_ start new stuff.

## Equal Opportunity

Another point to note is that the book spends considerably less time on explaining Toohey's thought process than it does on Roark, Keating, Dominique and Wynand.
This may be done intentionally in order to delay the recognition of his true intentions while at the same time allowing the reader to feel more in tune with Roark than Toohey, which is also one of the book's goals.
In any case, it works well.

## Roark's concept of owning

Roark talks about owning things by simply looking at them.
Everybody owns things in their own way, which no one else can steal or share.

I sort of got this when I was reading it.
But it later hit me when I was staring at a painting.

Each painting/piece of art has some intrinsic value and a perceived value.
The perceived value is entirely subjective and different in nature for every person who is looking at said art.
This is why some paintings are worth millions and while others arent as much.
This *perceived* value is what owning is, and can never be taken away from you.


## Two entries?
Whenever I do end up writing the final review of the book, I think a better approach would be to do publish two posts, one on the actual story of the book and how you find it purely from the perspective of storytelling.
While the other post could be about what you think of Ayn Rand's philosophy as you saw it explained via this story.

Rating: 5/5 ( Very Good)
