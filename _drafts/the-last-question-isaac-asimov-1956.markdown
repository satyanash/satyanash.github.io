title: "[Thoughts] The Last Question - Isaac Asimov (1956)"
---

I chanced upon 'The Last Question' from an unsuspecting Hacker News comment.
This was my first *real* encounter with Asimov's work.

I'd never read such a powerful short story before.
I find it very interesting that a short story could be considered one of the author's best works.


The narrative jumps though successive time periods between which mankind has achieved milestones in technology.
It begins with the humans having developed the technology to harness the sun's energy.
And it ends at a point where humans are immortal, are able to navigate the cosmos with ease and are fast exhausting the universe's energy.
In the end the only remaining entity is the AC which then spins a new world into action.

I immediately followed up and read the supposed counterpart to this story called 'The Last Answer'.
It was equally interesting and thought provoking.
