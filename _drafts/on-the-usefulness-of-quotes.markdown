I've always been fascinated by the amount of quotes that are thrown around.
You can find them everywhere: articles, tweets, posts, blogs and even whole books and websites dedicated to documenting quotes and their attributions.

Though they're intended to deliver wisdom in small doses, I think they fail horribly.
I think that quotes can be mainly divided into two types:

 * factual quotes
 * primarily opinion based directives to the reader
   * You must be the change you wish to see in the world. - Gandhi

The second kind are the ones that you should be wary of.
Most of these quotes and their assertions can be disproved by simple logic or thought experiments. 
If one must really use a quote it should be done in it's entirety and along with the context in which the words were uttered.
Though I must admit that it detracts the novelty of using them.

Often people justify their actions, intentions and lifestyle by quoting some random person.
I think this is very poisonous.
Two contradictory quotes are not very rare and are conveniently ignored in discussion.

Trying to take any sort of decision on the basis of quotes or using them to gain wisdom is a futile exercise.
