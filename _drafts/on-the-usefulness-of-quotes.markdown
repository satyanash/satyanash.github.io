According to [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quote): "**Quotation** is the repitition of someone else's statements or thoughts."
That is a very naive way to put it when you have people blatantly misquoting and mining quotes to construct (un)desirable phrases.

I've always been fascinated by the amount of quotes that are thrown around time and again.
You can find them everywhere: articles, tweets, posts, blogs and even whole books and websites dedicated to documenting quotes and their attributions.

I think that quotes can be mainly divided into two types:

 * factual quotes
 * primarily opinion based directives to the reader
   * You must be the change you wish to see in the world. - Gandhi

The second kind are the ones that you should be wary of.
They're often used to deliver wisdom and motivation in small doses, in which I think they fail horribly.
Most of these quotes and their assertions can be disproved by simple logic and thought experiments.

If one must really use a quote it should be done in it's entirety and along with the context in which the words were uttered.
It may detract the novelty of using them but that is the price one must pay for an unambiguous conveyance of information.

Often people justify their actions, intentions and lifestyle by quoting some random person.
I think this is very poisonous.
One should try to apply one's own judgement and reasoning instead of relying on the (often incomplete) words of dead people.
Two contradictory quotes are not very rare and are conveniently ignored in discussion.

Trying to take any sort of decision on the basis of quotes or using them to gain wisdom is a futile exercise.
