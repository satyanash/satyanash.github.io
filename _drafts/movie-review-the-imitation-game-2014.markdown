title: "[Movie Review] The Imitation Game (2014)"
---

This movie is about [Alan Turing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing), a mathematician, computer scientist, logician and cryptanalyst.

I don't know why they decided to name the machine Christopher of all things.
His romanticized memories of Christopher was a <del>crappy</del> queer way to introduce his homosexuality into the script and I feel it could've been done better in a different way.
This is specifically offensive when there actually was no Christopher and the movie never once mentions the word *Bombe* as these machines were actually called.

The movie fails to make it clear that the *Bombe* wasn't an invention of Turing but was a Polish invention which was then improved upon by Turing.

The movie also tries to show that Turing also helped in letting out a series of messages out to the forces through the use of statistics.
This is just crazy and can be considered a treason as this kind of information should never be concealed.
Turing was a mathematician, not a war strategist.

The attempt to use a non-linear narrative to add more 'suspense' to the story is a feeble one and the story could've been clearer without it.
It took me a while before I realized that the burglary actually happens after the war.

The movie's ending also shows that Turing has a weak spot for the machine that he's built and does not want to leave it alone.
I believe that this is an insult to his memory as for any good mathematician like Turing it was a challenge and once it was a solved it was no longer a prized possession or a gift to be fawned upon.
Turing in his real life probably moved onto more interesting and harder problems instead of crying over a machine.
The movie portrays him as a hopeless dying scientist who mourns the loss of his creation when clearly he was capable of better things.

The movie revolves too much around the creation than the creator and hence is a poor rendition of an excellent personality.

Rating: 3/5
