title: "[Movie Review] The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2013)"
---

This is a movie adaptation of the book 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower ( 1999)". It is about high school, coming-of-age and maybe finding love in the process.

The movie broaches many subjects that are considered to be of keen interest to teenagers such as love, sex and drugs.
It is also a movie about how fucked up the American society is where kids are sexually abused, gay people opressed by their own parents and students unnecessarily bullied in high school.
The kind of stratification that is projected by movies about high schools in America is really bad.

Charlie develops a close friendship with Sam and Patrick who are the two cousins forming the misfit gang of the high school.
He finds them more accomodating and do not impose on him in any way.

The movie also shows that even though people may appear to be completely fine from the outside they may be equally broken from the inside and need as much care as the next patient in a hospital.
The jock you see play the best game of football may have a sweet spot for boys himself.
The drunk girl you see dancing on the table may be there because she is just wanting to fit in and people to notice her.
The weird boy reading the book in the corner may be able to knock the tallest bullies in a single punch.

The movie's punchline: *You Are Infinite* is supposed to be a motivational message to all these people to not forget what they really like to do.
It is a reminder that one shouldn't give in to social pressures and follow the norms just because they are so.
This movie is a message about and to all those people who never managed to fit in the standard definitions of their teachers to not give up and follow their dreams.

The movie moves at a comfortable pace and keeps dropping hints that something is wrong with Charlie.
To the experienced viewer it may readily apparent that the Aunt Helen character is sinister and a cause of concern.

The movie talks about multiple topics in turn and never stays on one for too long.
It goes over the various problems faced by the group of misfits of which Charlie is a part.
It is difficult to pin point an exact issue about this film but the attention feels a but distributed.

It shows how Charlie grows up as a person, overcomes his suppressed memories and learns to live a life.

The movie makes a lot of primarily American pop culture references such as The Great Gatsby, To Kill a Mockingbird, The Rocky Horror Picture Show among others the significance of which will be completely lost to non-american viewers.
To some viewers, the significane of the scenes such as the Rocky Horror ones would be completely lost and would feel out of line, resulting in a panning.

All in all, this is an American movie which may probably be appreciable to you have encountered the American high school culture and it's problems at any given point of time. Otherwise do not bother watching it.

I haven't read the book yet, but I guess the book would do a better job of explaining the references.

Rating: 3/5 ( Average)
